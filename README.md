# Snake-2D-Using-Java
This is the classic snake game that we used to play on our phones .
I have used Swing and AWT for this java project.
The snake can be controlled by using arrow keys or A-S-D-W keys(you know real gamers prefer that).
I have made two classes :
1- Main class in which the size of the frame and other defaults values are set.
2- Gameplay class in which the movements and the graphics have been designed.
I am running this snake 3D java application on Eclipse.
